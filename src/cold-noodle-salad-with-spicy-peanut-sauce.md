- From: [link](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022329-cold-noodle-salad-with-spicy-peanut-sauce)

- Cooking Time: 20 minutes

## Ingredients:

- Kosher salt
- 10 ounces soba noodles
- 1 medium zucchini or cucumber (about 6 ounces)
- 5 radishes (about 4 ounces)
- 1 bell pepper (any color)
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1/2 cup roasted salted peanuts (about 2 ounces), roughly chopped
- 2 scallions, trimmed and finely chopped
- Handful of cilantro leaves
- 1 lime, cut into wedges for serving
- 1/2 cup smooth peanut butter (not natural)
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons lime juice (from 1 lime)
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 2 teaspoons chile oil or hot sauce, plus more to taste
- 1 garlic clove, grated

## Instructions:

Bring a pot of salted water to the boil. Add the soba, stir to prevent sticking, and cook according to package instructions until just tender. Rinse under cold water until the noodles are completely cold.

Meanwhile, make the sauce: In a medium bowl, combine the peanut butter, soy sauce, maple syrup, lime juice, sesame oil, chile oil or hot sauce, and garlic. Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and whisk until the sauce is a pourable consistency. Taste and add more chile oil or hot sauce as desired; set aside.

Cut the zucchini or cucumber and radishes into 1/8-inch thick slices, then cut into thin matchsticks. Slice the peppers into 1/8-inch pieces. Place them all in a large bowl.

Loosen the soba noodles by running them under some water, then allow to drain again. Add them to the vegetables, add the remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil and toss to combine.

When you are ready to serve, drizzle with spicy peanut sauce and top with peanuts, scallions and cilantro. Serve immediately, with lime wedges alongside.
