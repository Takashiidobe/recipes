# The classic, Kimchi Jjigae

- From: [link](https://mykoreankitchen.com/kimchi-jjigae/.md)

- Cooking Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 180 g skinless pork belly ((0.4 pounds), cut into bite size pieces)
- 1 Tbsp rice wine ((mirin))
- 3 sprinkles ground black pepper
- 3/4 cup aged Kimchi ((at least 2 to 3 weeks old), cut into bite size
  pieces if not already)
- 1/4 small brown onion ((30 g / 1 ounce), thinly sliced)
- 1/2 stalk small green onion ((5 g / 0.2 ounce), thinly sliced)
- 2 small shiitake mushrooms ((50 g / 1.4 ounces), stems removed,
  thinly sliced)
- 150 g firm tofu ((5.3 ounces), sliced into 1cm thickness rectangles,
  or other shapes you may prefer)
- 1 cup water
- 1 Tbsp Korean chili flakes ((gochugaru))
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp Korean chili paste ((gochujang))
- 1/4 tsp minced garlic
- 3 sprinkles ground black pepper

## Instructions:

Marinate the pork belly with the rice wine and the ground black pepper
for about 15 mins.

Cook the Kimchi in a skillet until soft. (You could do this in the pot
where you will make this jjigae. Do this only if the pot is big enough
to manoeuvre around.)

Put the marinated meat into the bottom of the pot. Add all the other
ingredients (kimchi, onion, mushrooms, tofu, water and the base sauce)
except for green onion into the pot.

Boil the pot on medium high heat initially then reduce the heat to
medium once it starts boiling. Cook further until the meat is cooked.
(It takes 10 to 15 mins from the beginning of step 4.) Make sure the
sauce is well blended into the rest of the ingredients. (This can be
done by gently mixing the sauce around the soup with a small teaspoon
and splashing the soup over other ingredients every now then). When the
meat is cooked, add the green onion and turn the heat off.

Serve with rice (and other side dishes).
