# Cucumber-Avocado Salad

- From: [link](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022411-cucumber-avocado-salad)

- Cooking Time: 15 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 2 scallions, trimmed then sliced crosswise 1/4-inch-thick
- Ice
- 1 pound cucumbers (such as 6 Persian or mini seedless, or 1 English)
- Kosher salt
- 2 very ripe avocados
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon or lime juice, or unseasoned rice vinegar, plus more as needed
- Red-pepper flakes or hot sauce, for serving

## Instructions:

Transfer the scallions to a small bowl of ice water to crisp.

Peel the cucumbers in alternating strips and trim ends. If desired, halve lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Cut cucumbers into bite-size pieces (thin slices, 1/2-inch cubes, or smashed into irregular shapes), then transfer to a colander set in the sink. Toss with 1 teaspoon salt and set aside to drain, at least 5 minutes or up to 15.

When youâ€™re ready to eat, halve the avocados and remove the pits. Using a spoon, remove the flesh from the skins, then cut the flesh into 1/2-inch cubes. Transfer to a large bowl, add the lemon juice and season with salt. Stir to combine.

Shake the cucumbers in the colander to get rid of any excess moisture, then transfer to the bowl with the avocado. Drain and shake the scallions in the colander. Add the scallions to the bowl.

Stir the salad ingredients vigorously just until the avocado breaks down a bit. The cucumbers should be glossed with avocado but the majority of the avocado pieces should still remain cubed. Season to taste with salt, lemon and red-pepper flakes or hot sauce.
