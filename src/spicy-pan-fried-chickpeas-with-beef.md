- Cooking Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 14 oz canned chickpeas
- 9 oz ground beef
- 1 chili
- 2 cloves garlic
- 0.75 oz parsley
- 1 lemon
- 1 cup water
- 1.25 cups full-fat plain yogurt
- 1 tsp ras el hanout
- 0.5 tsp ground cumin
- 0.25 ground cinnamon
- 3.5 oz Swiss chard
- salt
- pepper
- olive oil
- rice (cooked, for serving)
- sumac (for serving)

## Instructions:

Halve, deseed, and mince the chili. Mince the garlic. Roughly chop the
parsley. Grate and squeeze the lemon and set aside in separate bowls.
Drain the chickpeas, reserving the liquid. Add water to chickpea liquid.

To make the dressing, mix yogurt in a bowl with some lemon zest, all of
the lemon juice, half of the minced garlic, and most of the parsley,
reserving some for garnish later. Season with salt and pepper and set
aside.

Add some olive oil to a large frying pan over high heat, and fry the
beef until browned. Break up the meat with a spatula, continuing to cook
until browned all over. Remove from the pan and set aside.

Add more olive oil to the pan if necessary. Then add the chickpeas and
let toast for approx. 5 min., or until they brown and begin to pop. Add
the minced chili and remaining garlic, cooking for approx. 1 - 2 min.
Add the ras el hanout, ground cumin, and cinnamon, and stir to combine.
Let cook for approx. 1 min., or until fragrant. Reduce the heat to
medium, then add reserved chickpea liquid, along with the beef and
reserved lemon zest. Scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
Let simmer until all the liquid is absorbed.

Tear chard leaves into strips and add to the pan. Let cook for approx.
30 sec., or until slightly wilted. Remove from heat and serve with rice
and yogurt dressing. Garnish with parsley and a sprinkle of sumac, if
desired. Enjoy!
