- From: [link](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023359-spiced-roast-chicken-with-tangy-yogurt-sauce)

- Cooking Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 1/4 cup neutral oil, such as safflower or canola
- 5 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tablespoon ground coriander
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground sweet paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon granulated onion
- 1/4 cup chopped cilantro
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice, plus wedges for serving
- 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes
- Salt and black pepper
- 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt (2 percent or whole-milk)
- 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
- 3/4 teaspoon granulated sugar
- A big pinch of granulated garlic
- A big pinch of granulated onion
- Salt and black pepper
- To Serve:
- 1 small head iceberg lettuce, shredded
- 2 medium tomatoes, diced
- Warm pita bread and hot sauce (optional)

## Instructions:

Prepare the chicken: Heat oven to 450 degrees. In a medium bowl, combine the oil, fresh garlic, coriander, paprika, cumin, oregano and granulated onion with half of the cilantro and half of the lemon juice; mix well. Add the chicken, season with salt and pepper, and toss to evenly coat.

Spread the seasoned chicken in a single layer on a large sheet pan and roast until golden and caramelized, about 20 minutes.

While the chicken roasts, make the white sauce: In a small bowl, combine the yogurt, mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, granulated garlic and granulated onion; season with salt and pepper, then mix well; set aside.

Add the remaining cilantro and lemon juice to the roasted chicken and mix well, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Divide chicken, lettuce and tomatoes among 4 plates and drizzle with some of the white sauce. Serve with lemon wedges, plus pita and hot sauce, if using.
