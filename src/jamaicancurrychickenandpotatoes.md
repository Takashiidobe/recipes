# Jamaican Curry Chicken and Potatoes

- From:

- Cooking Time: 90 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken legs and thighs, skin removed
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed
- 1 large onion, sliced
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 tablespoons Jamaican hot curry powder, such as Jamaican Choice or
  Grace, plus more as needed
- 1 Scotch bonnet or habanero pepper
- 4 medium Yukon Gold potatoes, washed and quartered
- 1 to 2 quarts chicken stock (reduce or add liquid depending on pot
  size)
- 1 dried bay leaf
- 2 fresh thyme sprigs
- 1/4 cup cornstarch
- White rice, for serving

## Instructions:

Place chicken in a large bowl. Season chicken with the garlic powder, 2
teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, making sure it's evenly coated.
Let come to room temperature.

Heat a deep Dutch oven or heavy pan over medium-high. Drizzle in the
olive oil. Add sliced onions, season with salt and pepper. Using a
rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir to combine, and cook until soft and
fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic, stirring to keep the garlic from
scorching, and cook for 30 seconds or until tender. Using a pair of
tongs or a spoon, remove onions and garlic from the pan; set aside in a
bowl.

If needed, add more oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Reduce the heat
to medium. Add the room-temperature chicken to the pan, and sear chicken
on both sides, in batches if necessary, until golden brown, about 7 to 8
minutes total.

Sprinkle curry powder over and around chicken. Let the spices bloom and
toast until fragrant, about 2 minutes.

Add reserved onions and garlic to the pan. Using a paring knife, pierce
the Scotch bonnet pepper. Add to the pan. Add potatoes, and stir to
evenly coat chicken and potatoes.

Pour in chicken stock to nearly cover the chicken. Add the bay leaf and
thyme sprigs. Bring to a simmer. Remove Scotch bonnet pepper. Cover pot
and cook for 30 minutes, or until chicken is tender and falling off the
bone. Taste and adjust the curry powder, salt and pepper as needed.

In a small bowl, combine cornstarch with 1/4 cup water to form a slurry.
(The chicken curry can be eaten as is, like a soup, or slurry can be
added to thicken the sauce to a gravy-like consistency.) Add 1
tablespoon of the slurry, and bring to a boil to thicken, adding more
slurry to reach desired consistency. Retrieve bay leaf and thyme stems
and discard. Serve with rice.
