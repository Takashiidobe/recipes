- Cooking Time: 55 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 4 hamburger buns, split
- 1 head green leaf lettuce, leaves separated
- 1 beefsteak tomato, sliced
- 20 dill pickle slices
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 cup dill pickle juice
- 1 1/2 cups milk, divided
- 1 cup peanut oil
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Instructions:

Place a chicken breast on a cutting board. With your hand flat on top of
it, carefully slice the chicken in half horizontally. Trim excess fat as
needed.

In a large shallow baking dish, combine chicken, pickle juice and 1/2
cup milk; marinate for at least 30 minutes. Drain well.

Heat peanut oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.

In another large shallow baking dish, whisk together remaining 1 cup
milk and egg. Stir in chicken to coat and drain excess milk mixture.

In a gallon size Ziploc bag or large bowl, combine chicken, flour and
confectioners' sugar; season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Working in batches, add chicken to the skillet and cook until evenly
golden and crispy, about 4-5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined
plate.

Serve chicken immediately on burger buns with green leaf lettuce, tomato
and pickles.
