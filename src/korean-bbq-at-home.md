- 4-8 oz Banchan (at least 4 kinds, see post)
- 2 heads lettuce (mix/match of red leaf, green leaf, butter, romaine, iceberg)
- 2 packs perilla leaves
- 1 cup crunchy vegetables (julienned)
- 6-8 cloves garlic (raw, sliced)
- 2-3 jalape√±os (sliced)
- 6 cups cooked rice
- 16 oz naengmyeon (Korean cold noodles, prepared, optional)

## Instructions:

Well before you want to eat, make the marinade: In a blender, blend the onion, pear, garlic, and ginger with 1/4 cup water, then combine the onion-pear mix with the soy sauce, brown sugar, toasted sesame oil, and black pepper. Marinate your meats for a minimum of 2 hours or overnight: Kalbi short ribs: use 1/3 of the marinade with the Korean cut short ribsBulgogi brisket: use 1/3 of the marinade with your thinly sliced brisket (or sirloin or ribeye)Spicy Bulgogi pork belly: finally, add 1 tbsp gochujang (or more, if you want it spicier) to the remaining marinade and combine with the pork belly.

Combine the ssamjang ingredients to make the ssamjang. Set aside, covered, in the refrigerator so the flavors can meld.

Make the green onion slaw: Trim the green onions then cut into 3 inch lengths. Slice each piece longways so you get shredded green onions. Soak in cold water for 5 minutes, drain well, then toss the remaining ingredients. Refrigerate, covered, until ready to use.

When you are ready to eat, lay out the banchan on small plates, cook your rice, and divide your ssamjang and other seasonings up among the table.

Cook the meat on the hot plate/grill pan, flipping as needed. Enjoy as ssam!
