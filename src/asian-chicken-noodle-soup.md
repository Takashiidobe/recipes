- Cooking Time: 50 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 2.5 lb of Organic Free-Range Chicken (Asian Supermarket \* )
- 4 Slices of Ginger
- 6 Stalks of Green Onion
- 2 tbsp of Salt
- 6-8 cups of Water (not passing the chicken breast \*)
- 3 tbsp of Ginger grated
- 4 cloves of Garlic grated
- ¼ cup of Sesame Oil

## Instructions:

Prepare the chicken by cutting off the head, feet, and butt. Scrub and
exfoliate the chicken with salt inside and out. Rinse the chicken with
water and pat dry.

Add the chicken, ginger, 1 tbsp of salt, and 3 green onion in the
instant pot. Make sure the chicken breast is facing up before adding
water. Pour enough water depending on your instant pot's size to cover
most of the chicken except the chicken breast.

Set to pressure cook for 25 minutes

In the meantime, prepare your favorite noodles. Rinse the noodles with
cold water once cooked and set aside

In a bowl, grate in 3 tbsp of ginger, 4 cloves of grated garlic, 3
stalks of green onion chopped, and 1 tbsp of salt. Heat ¼ cup of Sesame
Oil, and once the oil is hot, pour the oil into the bowl. Ensure
removing the sesame oil before it turns dark as sesame oil burns quickly
and may become bitter. Mix everything and set it aside.

Remove the chicken from the broth and let it cool down on the side. It
is easier to cut chicken the chicken when it cools off for 10 minutes.

In a bowl, add in noodles, add in chicken and pour on the hot broth.
Serve with scallion-ginger oil, and enjoy!
