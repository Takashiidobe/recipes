# Ozoni (Japanese New Year Mochi Soup - Kanto Style)

- From: [link](https://www.justonecookbook.com/ozoni/)

- Cooking Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 1 chicken thigh ((5.6 oz, 160 g; you can increase the amount if you like; skip for vegetarian/vegan))
- 4 stalks komatsuna ((3.5 oz, 100 g, 3.5 oz; or use spinach))
- 4 kirimochi or homemade mochi
- yuzu zest ((optional))
- 4 mitsuba (Japanese parsley) ((optional))
- 1 Tbsp sake
- ¼ tsp kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)
- 4 cups dashi (Japanese soup stock; click to learn more)
- 1 Tbsp sake
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)

## Instructions:

Gather all the ingredients.

Cut the chicken into bite-size pieces and put them in a small bowl, add ¼ tsp kosher salt.

Add 1 Tbsp sake and mix well with hands. Let the chicken marinated for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, blanch the komatsuna or spinach in boiling water and cook until tender (do not overcook). Soak in iced water after removing from pot to stop cooking further.

Squeeze the water out and cut the komatsuna into 1 ½ inch (3 cm) length.

Make a knot with each mitsuba’s stem. Peel the yuzu skin.

If there is too much pith (the white fuzzy thing) was removed along with yuzu’s skin, trim with knife. Julienne the yuzu peel very thinly.

Add 4 cups (960 ml) dashi in a large saucepan or pot and bring it to boil. Once boiling, add the chicken pieces.

Once all the chicken is added, cover to cook for 5-7 minutes, depending on the size of chicken.

Once the chicken is cooked, skim the foam and fat on the surface.

Add 1 Tbsp sake, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and 1 tsp kosher salt. Mix well and keep it on simmer.

When everything else is ready, start toasting mochi in a toaster oven. Optionally you can do this on a frying pan or oven as well.

Serve the chicken and soup, add the mochi and komatsuna, and finally topped with mitsuba and yuzu. Enjoy immediately.

To Store

You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container or in the pot and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
