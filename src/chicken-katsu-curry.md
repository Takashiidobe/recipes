- Cooking Time: 45 minutes

## Ingredients:

- seasoned flour for dusting
- egg 1, beaten
- natural dried breadcrumbs 100g
- skinless, boneless chicken thighs 4 large
- basmati rice 100g
- frozen peas 75g
- sesame oil
- soy sauce
- onion 1, chopped
- garlic 2 cloves, crushed
- ginger a small chunk, peeled and finely chopped
- chilli flakes a pinch (optional)
- oil for frying
- plain flour or mild curry powder 1 tbsp
- chicken stock 350ml
- brown sugar (any kind will work) 1 tsp

## Instructions:

Put the flour, egg and breadcrumbs in separate dishes. Dust the chicken
in flour, then the egg, then breadcrumbs. Chill for 20 minutes.

To make the curry sauce cook the onion, garlic and ginger (and chilli
flakes if using) in a little splash of oil until softened. Add the flour
and curry powder mix, and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring to stop it
catching. Slowly add the chicken stock then stir in the sugar and simmer
for 15 minutes. Blend the sauce to smooth using a stick blender or food
processor.

Heat the oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a non-stick
frying pan. Fry the chicken until golden on both sides then transfer to
a rack and finish cooking in the oven for 20 minutes.

Boil the rice in lots of salted water, adding the peas for the last 2
minutes of cooking. Drain well then toss with a couple of drops of
sesame oil and soy. Slice the chicken and arrange on top of the rice
then serve with a drizzle of the reheated sauce. You might also like:
