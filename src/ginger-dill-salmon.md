# Ginger-Dill Salmon

- From: [link](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021938-ginger-dill-salmon)

- Cooking Time: 25 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 1 (1 1/2-pound) salmon fillet, skin-on or skinless
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 6 tablespoons finely chopped dill
- 1 (2-inch) piece ginger, scrubbed and finely grated (no need to peel)
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
- 1 grapefruit
- 2 oranges
- 6 small radishes, cut into thin wedges
- 1 avocado
- Flaky sea salt, for finishing (optional)

## Instructions:

Heat oven to 325 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Pat the salmon dry, then place on the tray skin-side down (if there is skin) and season with salt and pepper.

In a medium bowl, stir together the dill, ginger and olive oil until combined. Season with salt and pepper. Spread half of the dill-ginger mixture over the top of the salmon. (Reserve the remaining dill-ginger mixture.) Bake until cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. (Youâ€™ll know the salmon is done when the fish flakes or an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part is 120 degrees.)

As the salmon cooks, cut off the top and bottom of the grapefruit and set the grapefruit down on one of the cut sides. Follow the curve of the fruit to cut away the peel and pith. Squeeze the peels into the remaining dill-ginger mixture to get out any juice. Cut the fruit in half from top to bottom, then slice into 1/4-inch-thick half-moons and remove the seeds. If your pieces are especially large, halve them again. Transfer the fruit and any juice on the cutting board to the bowl. Repeat with the oranges. Add the radishes, season generously with salt, and stir gently to combine.

Break the salmon into large pieces, and divide across plates with the citrus salad. Peel and pit the avocado, then quarter lengthwise and add to plates. Season with salt. Spoon the juices from the bowl over top, and season with black pepper, another drizzle of olive oil, and flaky sea salt, if using.
