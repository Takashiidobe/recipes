- Cooking Time: 10 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt
- 2 1/2 cups buttermilk
- 2 large eggs
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- Vegetable, canola or coconut oil for the pan

## Instructions:

Heat the oven to 325 degrees. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking
soda and kosher salt together in a bowl. Using the whisk, make a well in
the center. Pour the buttermilk into the well and crack eggs into
buttermilk. Pour the melted butter into the mixture. Starting in the
center, whisk everything together, moving towards the outside of the
bowl, until all ingredients are incorporated. Do not overbeat (lumps are
fine). The batter can be refrigerated for up to one hour.

Heat a large nonstick griddle or skillet, preferably cast-iron, over low
heat for about 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet. Turn heat
up to medium--low and using a measuring cup, ladle 1/3 cup batter into
the skillet. If you are using a large skillet or a griddle, repeat once
or twice, taking care not to crowd the cooking surface.

Flip pancakes after bubbles rise to surface and bottoms brown, about 2
to 4 minutes. Cook until the other sides are lightly browned. Remove
pancakes to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet, and keep in
heated oven until all the batter is cooked and you are ready to serve.
