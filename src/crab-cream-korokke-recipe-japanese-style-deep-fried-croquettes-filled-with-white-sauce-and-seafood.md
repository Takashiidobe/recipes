# Crab Cream Korokke Recipe (Japanese-style Deep-Fried Croquettes Filled with White Sauce and Seafood)

- Cooking Time: 35 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 20 g Unsalted Butter
- 60 g Onion (chopped)
- 40 g Button Mushroom (chopped)
- 25 g Bread Flour (sieved beforehand, substitute: cake flour or all
  purpose flour)
- 150 ml Milk
- 60 g Crab Meat (boiled)
- 1.5 g Salt
- White Pepper
- Bread Flour
- 1/2 Egg (large-size)
- Panko (finely ground type, Japanese breadcrumbs)
- Tomato Wedge
- Lettuce Leaf
- Frying Oil
- Vegetable Oil (to coat with the kitchen gloves and tray)

## Instructions:

First, let\'s prepare the crab meat. Flake the crab meat with your
fingers. If using canned crab, drain the liquid in a strainer before
use.

Next, cut it with kitchen shears into smaller pieces.

Next, let\'s make the filling for the korokke. Heat a frying pan and
melt the unsalted butter.

When the butter has melted, add the chopped onion and stir-fry.

Stir-fry the onion until it turns translucent.

Add the chopped button mushrooms.

Cook for about 2 minutes to reduce the moisture.

Then, turn the heat to low and add the bread flour.

The bread flour will make the filling gooier and stickier than cake
flour, so it is suitable for cream korokke. If you prefer a silkier,
lighter texture, use cake flour or all-purpose flour instead.

Stir-fry until the flour is thoroughly cooked. By cooking the flour
thoroughly, the powdery smell will disappear and transform into an
appetizing aroma.

Now, turn off the heat and add all the milk at once.

Mix it well to blend evenly.

Turn on the heat and stir lightly.

Then, add the crab meat, salt and white pepper.

Continue stirring on medium-high heat until the mixture thickens.

When the mixture has reached the thick consistency as shown, transfer it
to a tray.

The tray is greased with vegetable oil to make it easier to remove
later.

Flatten the filling and tightly cover it with plastic wrap.

Place the tray on ice and put ice packs on it to cool as soon as
possible. Then, chill the tray in the fridge until cold.

Now, the filling has chilled. Mark it into 6 equal portions.

Coat your hands with vegetable oil. Then, take one-sixth of the filling.

Shape the piece into a circle while pushing the air out of it. If any
air is trapped inside, it will burst in the hot oil.

Today, we\'ll use a circular shape, but a cylindrical shape is also
popular.

The heat of your hands will make the filling sticky, so wearing kitchen
gloves will make it easier to handle.

Once all the filling is shaped into circles, remove the gloves and dust
them with flour. Use a spatula to transfer the filling into the bowl so
it doesn\'t lose its shape.

Adjust the shape while covering it with flour. It\'s easier to work with
plenty of flour in the bowl.

Now, all the pieces are covered with flour.

Next, lightly dust off the excess flour and dip the filling in the
beaten egg.

Again, using a spatula will keep it from breaking and help to keep your
hands clean.

Then, cover the fillings with a generous amount of panko, Japanese
breadcrumbs and arrange them on a tray.

You should use finely ground panko since it coats more evenly and
doesn\'t come off as readily. If you only have coarsely ground panko,
put it in a plastic bag and roll it with a rolling pin over the bag to
make it finer.

As for the remaining flour and panko, sift each with a strainer into
another bag, store them in the refrigerator or freezer, and use up as
soon as possible.

And now, let\'s deep-fry the korokke. Heat the frying oil to 175 °C (347
°F).

Place only 3 korokke in the oil at a time. If you put too many pieces in
the oil at once, the oil temperature will drop and the korokke won\'t
fry properly, so be sure to fry them a few at a time.

Once the korokke are in the oil, move them gently so as not to disturb
the coating.

Flip them over.

Deep-fry them for a total of 2 to 3 minutes until deliciously browned.

Then, remove and drain the excess oil.

Place the korokke onto a cooling rack.

These korokke are excellent with fresh tomatoes, lettuce or other
vegetables of your choice.
