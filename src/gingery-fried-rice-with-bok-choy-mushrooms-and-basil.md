- Cooking Time: 20 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 4 cups cooked, day-old jasmine rice (or 1 cup uncooked jasmine rice; see Tip)
- 5 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil
- 3/4 pound mixed fresh mushrooms, such as shiitake and cremini, thinly sliced, or whole shimeji mushrooms
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 3/4 pound baby bok choy (about 8 small baby bok choy), trimmed, then sliced crosswise 1/2-inch thick
- 5 scallions, trimmed, greens and whites thinly sliced (about 1/2 cup)
- 3 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
- 1 jalapeño, thinly sliced (optional)
- 3/4 cup frozen peas
- 2 to 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh ginger (from one 2-inch piece)
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil
- 1/8 teaspoon white pepper (optional)
- 1/2 cup thinly sliced fresh basil

## Instructions:

Take the cooked rice out of the refrigerator, and set it aside at room temperature.

In a large wok or nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons canola oil over medium-high. Add the mushrooms, season generously with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and tender, 5 or 6 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.

Wipe out the skillet, if needed, then add 1 tablespoon canola oil and heat over medium-high. Add the bok choy, scallions, garlic and jalapeño, if using. Season with salt and pepper and stir-fry, stirring frequently, until aromatic and barely crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to the bowl with the mushrooms.

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons canola oil to the skillet and heat over medium-high. Add the rice and cook, stirring occasionally, until toasted and toothsome, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the frozen peas, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil and white pepper (if using), and stir until rice is evenly coated in soy sauce mixture, and no uncoated rice grains remain, 1 to 2 minutes.

Stir in the mushroom and bok choy mixture and the basil until basil is wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper then divide among bowls; serve hot.
