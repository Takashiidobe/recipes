- Cooking Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 4 egg whites and 2 egg yolks from 4 large eggs, separated and
  chilled
- 6 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 6 tablespoons cake flour
- 1/4 cup milk, chilled
- 1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- Unsalted butter, for greasing and serving
- Maple syrup, for serving
- Confectioners' sugar, whipped cream and fresh berries, for serving
  (optional)

## Instructions:

Place egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer or a medium bowl; set
aside. Place egg yolks in a large bowl. Add 1 tablespoon granulated
sugar, the vanilla and baking powder to egg yolks and whisk until
blended. Add flour and milk; whisk until fully combined.

Add lemon juice and salt to egg whites. Using a stand mixer fitted with
the whisk attachment or a hand mixer, whip mixture on medium speed until
foamy, about 1 minute. Continue to whip over medium while gradually
sprinkling with remaining 5 tablespoons granulated sugar. Turn speed to
high and whip until stiff, glossy peaks form and mixture doubles in
size, about 1 minute. Take care not to overbeat meringue.

Heat a lidded nonstick skillet over the lowest heat setting and set the
lid aside.

Using a rubber spatula, scoop about 1/3 of meringue into egg yolk
mixture and gently fold almost combined. Repeat with half the remaining
meringue until almost combined, then fold in the remaining meringue just
until no streaks remain.

Carefully grease the warm skillet and the inside of four 3-inch-wide
pastry rings (they should be at least 1 1/2 inches tall) using the
butter. Check the heat of the pan by sprinkling a bit of water in it:
Droplets should steam off the surface, but not dance or sputter. Place
the greased pastry rings in the warm pan and ladle a scant 1/2 cup
batter into each ring. Place lid on top of skillet and cook pancakes on
very low heat until they start to rise and a few small bubbles start to
form on top, 3 to 4 minutes.

Remove lid, carefully slide a flat spatula underneath each pancake and
position another spatula on top, then gently flip pancakes in their
rings. Immediately replace lid and cook until pancakes are cooked
through and spring back to the touch, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer cooked
pancakes to a platter, grease the skillet and pastry rings and repeat to
make 4 additional pancakes.

Top pancakes with a pat of butter and drizzle with maple syrup; serve
immediately. Serve with any combination of confectioners' sugar, whipped
cream and berries, if desired.
