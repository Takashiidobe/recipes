# Japanese Hamburger Steak (Hambagu)

- From:
  [link](https://www.justonecookbook.com/hamburger-steak-hambagu/.md)

- Cooking Time: 85 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 5 oz onion ((½ onion))
- 1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc)
- ¾ lb ground beef & pork combination
- ½ tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table
  salt)
- freshly ground black pepper
- ½ tsp nutmeg
- ⅓ cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)
- 2 Tbsp milk
- 1 large egg (50 g w/o shell)
- 1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc)
- 3 Tbsp red wine
- 1 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 3 Tbsp ketchup ((Adjust the amount - some ketchup is sweeter than
  others))
- 3 Tbsp tonkatsu sauce
- 3 Tbsp red wine
- 3 Tbsp water

## Instructions:

Gather all the ingredients.

To Make Hambagu Patties

Chop the onion finely. With the knife tip pointing toward the root,
slice the onion to within ½ inch of the base. Make about ¼ inch parallel
cuts. Then slice the onion horizontally about ¼ inch parallel cuts.

Then cut perpendicular to the first slices you made. If the onions need
to be chopped finer, you can run your knife through them in a rocking
motion. Be sure to hold down the tip of the knife; otherwise, the onions
are going to go flying around the room.

Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat and add the onion.

Sauté the onion until tender and almost translucent. Transfer to a large
bowl and let it cool.

Once the onion is cool, add the ground beef and pork in the bowl. Add ½
tsp salt, black pepper, and ½ tsp nutmeg.

Add 2 Tbsp milk, ⅓ cup Panko, and an egg.

Start mixing all together with a silicone spatula/spoon.

Then switch to hand and knead the mixture until sticky and pale.

Divide the mixture into quarters (or you can make 6 smaller patties) and
scoop out each portion.

Toss it from one hand to the other hand repeatedly about 5 times in
order to release the air inside the mixture (see the video link above).
Tip: Without releasing air, the hamburger steaks will likely crack while
cooking if you don't release the air inside.

Make oval shape patties (4 oz or 113 g each). Cover with plastic and
keep in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before cooking so that the
meat combines together and fat will be solidified.

To Cook the Hambagu

In a large pan, heat 1 Tbsp oil over medium heat and place the patties
gently on the pan. Indent the center of each patty with 2 fingers
because the center of patties will rise with the heat.

Cook the patties until brown on the bottom side, about 3 minutes. Then
carefully flip and cook for another 3 minutes until browned.

Add 3 Tbsp red wine and reduce the heat to low heat. Cover with a lid
and cook for 5-7 minutes to thoroughly cook the inside of the patties
(Please adjust cooking time depending on thickness).

Uncover and check doneness by inserting a skewer. If clear juice comes
out, it\'s done. Increase heat to medium heat to let the wine evaporate.
When it's almost gone, transfer the hambagu steaks into individual
plates. Do not wash the pan as you will make the sauce next. Tip: You
can serve sauteed vegetables or salad along with Hambagu.

To Make the Sauce

In the same frying pan (without cleaning), add 1 Tbsp unsalted butter, 3
Tbsp ketchup, and 3 Tbsp Tonkatsu Sauce.

Add 3 Tbsp wine and 3 Tbsp water.

Mix well together and bring the sauce on medium heat to simmer and let
the alcohol evaporate.

When the sauce thickens (you can draw a line on the bottom of the frying
pan with a spatula), remove from the heat. Drizzle the sauce over the
hamburger steaks. Pour the leftover sauce in a small bowl or jar and
bring it to the table in case anyone wants to add more. We typically
serve steamed rice, miso soup, and maybe a salad with this meal.

To Store

You can store the hamburger steaks in an airtight container after
cooking them and letting cool completely. You can store in the
refrigerator for up to 3 days and the freezer for up to a month.
