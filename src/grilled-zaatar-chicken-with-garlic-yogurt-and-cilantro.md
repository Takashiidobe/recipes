- From: [link](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022300-grilled-zaatar-chicken-with-garlic-yogurt-and-cilantro)

- Cooking Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 6 garlic cloves, finely grated, pressed, or minced
- 2 lemons, zested
- 1 cup plain whole-milk yogurt
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more sprigs for garnish
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
- 1 1/2 tablespoons za’atar, plus more for serving
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano or marjoram, plus more sprigs for garnish
- 1 3/4 teaspoons salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 1/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs

## Instructions:

In a large bowl or container, stir together 5 of the grated garlic cloves, half the lemon zest, 1/3 cup yogurt, the cilantro, oil, za’atar, oregano or marjoram, salt and black pepper. Add chicken and toss until well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.

When ready to cook, light the grill to medium or heat your broiler with the rack 3 inches from the heat source. Remove chicken from bowl, shaking off any excess marinade, and grill or broil on one side until charred in spots, 5 to 8 minutes. Flip the chicken and grill or broil for another 5 to 8 minutes, until just cooked through.

While the chicken is cooking, place remaining 2/3 cup yogurt in a small bowl. Stir in the reserve grated garlic clove and lemon zest, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Cut one zested lemon in half and set aside for serving (save the other zested lemon for another use).

To serve, place chicken on a serving platter and drizzle with olive oil and a large squeeze of the zested lemon. Top with cilantro and oregano or marjoram sprigs and serve with yogurt sauce.
