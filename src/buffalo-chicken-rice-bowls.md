# Buffalo Chicken Rice Bowls

- From: [link](https://mealprepmanual.com/buffalo-chicken-rice-bowls/)

- Cooking Time: 40 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 2 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs
- 1 tbsp chili powder
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp pepper
- 3 cups cooked rice
- 2 medium zucchini
- 8 oz mushrooms
- ½ medium onion
- ½ cup cheddar cheese (shredded)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 4 tbsp buffalo sauce

## Instructions:

For the Rice

Cook enough rice to yield 3 cups of cooked rice. 1 cup of dry rice will make around 2-3 cups of cooked rice depending on what kind you use.

For the Chicken

In a large bowl add the chicken, a bit of oil, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Toss to coat.

You can cook your chicken however you like. I baked mine at 425°F for 10 minutes and then broiled it on the top rack for 5 minutes to develop color. Cut into 1 inch pieces. If you would rather pan fry it follow the instructions in the next step.

Heat a grill pan or a skillet over medium high heat and add some oil. Cook the chicken thighs for 4-5 minutes on each side. Cut them into a large dice and return to the pan to develop color.

For the Vegetables

Wash and cut your zucchini into a small dice and mushrooms into a large dice. Cut the onion into a small dice.

Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add oil and saute the onions for a couple of minutes.

Add a bit more oil and add in the mushrooms, season with salt to help bring out the water. Allow them to cook and develop color.

Add in the zuchinni and cook until soft.

Measure out 3 cups of cooked rice and add to a large bowl. Mix in the chicken, vegetables, cheese, and buffalo sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
