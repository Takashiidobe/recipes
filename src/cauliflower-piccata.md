# Cauliflower Piccata

- From: [link](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022614-cauliflower-piccata)

- Cooking Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 1 cauliflower, cut into large 2-inch florets
- Extra-virgin olive oil
- Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste
- 1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained (optional)
- 1 shallot, finely diced
- 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 cup vegetable stock
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons capers, drained
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 lemon)
- Parsley, chopped, for garnish
- 1 lemon, sliced, for serving

## Instructions:

Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Place the cauliflower florets onto a sheet pan and drizzle with 2 to 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Season with kosher salt and black pepper, and roast for 20 to 25 minutes, until the cauliflower is golden and tender. Remove from the oven, add the chickpeas, if using, and toss to combine.

Heat a medium skillet to medium-high. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the shallot, and saut√© until soft and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute longer, stirring constantly to keep from scorching. Pour the stock into the pan and simmer until reduced by half, about 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low, then stir in the butter, capers, lemon zest and juice. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt and a few turns of black pepper.

To serve, place the cauliflower and chickpeas, if using, on serving plates. Top with the lemon caper sauce. Top with parsley and serve with lemon slices.
