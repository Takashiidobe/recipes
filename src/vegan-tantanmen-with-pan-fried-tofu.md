# Vegan Tantanmen With Pan-Fried Tofu

- From: [link](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022099-vegan-tantanmen-with-pan-fried-tofu)

- Cooking Time: 45 minutes

## Ingredients:

- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 12 ounces dried ramen noodles
- 3 to 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 (12-ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained and sliced crosswise, 1/4-inch thick
- 8 large shiitake mushrooms (about 8 ounces), trimmed and thinly sliced
- 4 cups vegetable stock
- 1 (5-by-6-inch) piece dried kombu (about 1/2 ounce), optional
- 2 cups soy or oat milk, at room temperature
- 1/2 cup Chinese or Japanese sesame paste, or use tahini
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons chile oil, plus more for serving
- 1 cup frozen corn, defrosted and drained, if needed
- 4 scallions, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon roasted sesame seeds

## Instructions:

Bring a pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add noodles and cook until al dente, according to package instructions. Drain and run under cold water until the noodles are completely cold. (This stops the noodles from cooking further.) Set aside to drain.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high. When hot, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and arrange the tofu slices in a single layer. Generously season the tofu with about 1/2 teaspoon salt and about 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Reduce heat to medium, and cook tofu for 3 to 4 minutes until golden. Flip the tofu, and cook until golden on the other side, about 2 to 3 minutes. (Depending on the size of your skillet, you may need to cook your tofu in two batches.) Remove from the pan, set aside on a plate.

To the same pan, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper. Pan-fry until mushrooms are tender and slightly golden, about 6 minutes.

Prepare the broth: Pour the vegetable stock into a large pot and add the kombu, if using.

Bring to a gentle simmer and cook over medium heat, about 7 minutes. Remove kombu (keep for another use) and turn off heat. Allow to sit for 2 minutes, then gradually whisk in milk, adding a little at a time, so it doesnâ€™t curdle. Once the milk has been added, heat broth over medium until it simmers.

In a medium bowl, combine the sesame paste, soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, sugar and chile oil. Divide mixture across four deep noodle bowls.

Pour the hot broth over the sesame soup base, dividing it evenly among the bowls. Whisk to combine the base with the broth.

Divide the noodles across the bowls, and top each bowl with a few slices of tofu, mushrooms, corn, scallions, sesame seeds and an extra drop of chile oil.
