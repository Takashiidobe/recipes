# Vegetarian Pad See Ew

- From: [link](https://tasty.co/recipe/vegetarian-pad-see-ew.md)

- Cooking Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons vegetarian mushroom oyster sauce
- 1 tablespoon light brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon thai bird chile powder
- 16 oz extra firm tofu, cut into 1 inch (2 cm) cubes
- 1 lb rice noodle, fresh wide
- 3 tablespoons canola oil, divided
- â…“ cup shallot
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon water
- 12 oz broccoli, Chinese broccoli, cut diagonally into 2 in (5 cm)
  pieces
- 2 large eggs, beaten

## Instructions:

In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, vegetarian oyster sauce,
brown sugar, and chile powder.

Add the tofu to a medium bowl and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the
sauce. Gently toss to coat. Reserve the rest of the sauce.

Using your hands, break up the sheets of noodles into individual
noodles. Set aside.

Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large nonstick wok or skillet over high
heat, swirling the pan to coat. Working in batches, add the tofu to the
pan in a single layer and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side, until
browned. Flip and brown on the other side, 1-2 minutes more. Remove from
the pan and set aside.

Add the remaining tablespoon of canola oil to the pan. Add the shallot
to the pan and cook until tender and lightly browned, about 2 minutes.
Add the garlic and water and cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Add
the Chinese broccoli and cook, tossing occasionally, until crispy and
tender, 2-3 minutes. Add the reserved rice noodles, tofu, and sauce and
toss to combine. Cook until the noodles are warmed through and coated in
the sauce, 1-2 minutes.

Push the noodles to one side of the pan and pour the eggs into the empty
space. Cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly, until the eggs are
scrambled. Toss to incorporate the eggs into the rest of the dish.

Divide between 4 serving plates.

Enjoy!
