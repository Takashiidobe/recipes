# Tonjiru (Pork and Vegetable Miso Soup)

- From: [link](https://japan.recipetineats.com/tonjiru-pork-and-vegetable-miso-soup/)

- Cooking Time: 25 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 150g (5.3oz) pork belly (, thinly sliced, cut into bite size pieces (note 1))
- 600ml (20.3oz) dashi stock ((note 2))
- 2 tbsp miso ((note 3))
- 100g (3.5oz) daikon ((white radish), quartered and sliced 7mm thick)
- 100g (3.5oz) carrots (, halved and sliced 7mm (1/4") thick (note 5))
- ½ konnyaku block (, halved lengthwise and sliced 7mm (1/4") thick (note 6))
- 100g (3.5oz) potatoes (, cut into 2cm (3/4") cubes)
- 40g (1.4oz) burdock (, thinly sliced or shredded (note 7))
- 2 shallot ((scallion) stems, chopped into 2.5cm (1”) lengths)
- Julienned white part of shallots ((scallions))
- Shichimi tōgarashi ((Japanese spice mixture))

## Instructions:

Heat a saucepan with a dash of oil (not in ingredients, note 8) and sauté pork over high heat until the surface of the pork is cooked.

Add all the vegetables except shallots to the pan and sauté until the surface of the vegetables are cooked (surface becomes semi-transparent in the case of potatoes).

Add dashi stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook for about 10 minutes or until vegetables are cooked through.

Add miso gradually, diluting into the soup. Add shallots, turn the heat up to medium low and cook for a couple of minutes.

Serve hot soup into a standard bowl or a large soup bowl topped with julienned shallots if using accompanied by tōgarashi.
