# Curry Udon

- From: [link](https://www.justonecookbook.com/curry-udon/.md)

- Cooking Time: 50 minutes

## Ingredients:

- Â½ onion ((5.7 oz, 162 g))
- 2 green onions/scallions ((finely chopped))
- 1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc)
- 6 oz thinly sliced pork loin ((or use your choice of protein; cut
  into small pieces))
- 1 Tbsp sake
- 3 cups dashi (Japanese soup stock; click to learn more) ((720 ml))
- 2 cubes Japanese curry roux
- 2 tsp soy sauce
- 2 servings udon noodles ((6.3 oz/180 g dry udon noodles; 1.1 lb/500
  g frozen/boiled udon noodles))

## Instructions:

Gather all the ingredients. For curry roux, you will need to break into
cubes and use 2 pieces. Prepare dashi with your preferred method, if you
haven\'t made yet.

Thinly slice the onion and green onions.

In a medium pot (I used a 2.75 QT Staub), heat oil on medium heat and
add the onion.

Saute the onion for 2-3 minutes, and then add the meat.

Cook the meat until almost no longer pink and add sake.

Add dashi and cover with the lid. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook
for 5 minutes.

When simmering, skim off the scum and fat from the stock and continue to
cook.

Meanwhile, start boiling a large pot of water for udon.

After 5 minutes, turn off the heat. Put the cube of the curry roux in a
ladle, letting dissolve one cube at a time (We\'ll use 2 cubes total).

With chopsticks or spoon, let the roux dissolves completely in a ladle,
before releasing it to the soup. Tip: You don\'t want to eat a chunk of
undissolved curry roux, so take your time to dissolve the roux
completely.

Add soy sauce and mix well. Turn off the heat and cover the lid to keep
it warm.

When water is boiling, cook your udon noodles according to the package
instruction (For this Sanuki Udon, cook frozen noodles in boiling water
for 1 minute).

Drain the noodles and divide into two bowls. Pour the curry over the
udon noodles. Top with green onion and serve immediately.
