# Slow Roast Leg of Lamb

- Cooking Time: 330 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 2.25 kg / 4.5 lb leg of lamb , bone in (or shoulder) (Note 1)
- Salt and pepper
- 1.5 tbsp olive oil
- 1 whole garlic head (, unpeeled, cut in half horizontally)
- 1 onion (, quartered (unpeeled is fine))
- 2 rosemary sprigs ((2 = whisper of rosemary flavour, 4 sprigs =
  stronger flavour))
- 3 cups (750 ml) beef stock/broth (, low sodium)
- 2 cups (500 ml) water
- 4 tbsp (50g) flour ((white))
- 1 cup (250 ml) water
- Salt and pepper (, to taste)

## Instructions:

Preheat oven to 170°C/335°F (standard) or 150°C (fan).

Place garlic, onion and rosemary in a metal roasting pan.

Place lamb leg right side up in the pan. (Note 2)

Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper and rub it in.

Turn lamb over and place it so it mostly sits on the garlic and onion.
Sprinkle with more salt and pepper, rub it in. (Video helpful here)

Drizzle lamb with olive oil. Pour broth and water around the lamb - it
won\'t cover it, that\'s ok, the lamb sinks into it. Cover with foil
(don\'t use a lid, you want a bit of liquid to steam out).

Place in the oven and roast for 4.5 hours. (See Notes for roasting time
table)

Remove from the oven, remove foil. Turn lamb over. Check it to ensure
the meat is tender (pry a bit off with a fork). If not, return, covered,
to oven.

Return uncovered lamb to oven for a further 45 minutes or until well
browned.

Remove lamb, spoon over pan juices generously. Transfer to serving
platter, cover loosely with foil while you make the gravy (stays warm
for 1 - 1.5 hours).

Gravy:

Use a large spoon to skim off some of the fat from the surface of the
liquid.

Place pan on the stove on medium high. When the liquid bubbles, add
flour.

Use a whisk to mix it in - this may take a few minutes as the liquid
reduces.

Once it looks like sludge (see video), whisk in 1/2 - 1 cup of water
until it becomes a gravy consistency to your taste. Adjust salt and
pepper to taste - I rarely add extra salt.

Strain gravy into a bowl, pressing juices out of the onion etc.

Pour gravy into jug.

Serving:

The meat is tender so you will only need tongs to tear the meat off.
Serve with gravy.
